### How to work with Habitat ?

AI habitat has 2 repos from facebook AI, one is the Habitat-lab and the other
is the Habitat-sim. We need to install both libraries to make the custom 
script work. 

In the both repo's, they mentioned how to install the habitat-lab and 
habitat-sim. 

Habitat-lab: https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab
Habitat-sim: https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim

Once the install is done. 
The next part is example data to test, the agents in the enviroment and 
To test how 3d models work with Habitat-lab and How we can deploy agents 
with Habitat-sim 

The example for 3D Data to test this.

I am not the owner of the data, I am just storing it for the sake convence 
for my team. I am including terms and conditions of the owner, if you need 
anything.

Now you have everything you need to run the custom script.
